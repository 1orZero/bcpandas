# Master To-Do list

- **COME UP WITH A GOOD NAME!** (`pandasql` is already taken in PyPI) Needs to be changed in:
    - Folder name
    - `__init__.py`
    - `setup.py`
- Fix up `setup.py`
- Add conda recipe `meta.yaml` file
- Write tests
- Find way to automate creation of temp SQL Server db for testing


... and of course, anything marked `# TODO` in the code.
